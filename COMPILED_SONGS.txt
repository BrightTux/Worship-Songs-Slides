"We Are The Reason"
David Meece
-------------
As little children
We would dream of Christmas morn
And all the gifts and toys
We knew we’d find
But we never realised
A baby born one blessed night
Gave us the greatest gift of our lives
As the years went by
We learnt more about gifts
And giving of ourselves
And what that means
On a dark and cloudy day
A man hung crying in the rain
Because of love, because of love
We are the reason
That He gave His life
We are that reason
That He suffered and died
To a world that was lost
He gave all He could give
To show us the reason to live
I’ve finally found the reason for living
It’s in giving every part of my heart to Him
And all that I do every word that I say
I’ll be living my life just for Him
For Him

"In Christ Alone"
Keith Getty & Stuart Townend
-------------
In Christ alone, my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand
In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For ev’ry sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live
There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His, and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ
No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow’r of Christ in me
From life’s first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No pow’r of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the pow’r of Christ I’ll stand
I find my strength, I find my hope
I find my help, in Christ alone
When fear assails, when darkness falls
I find my peace, in Christ alone
I give my life, I give my all
I sing this song, to Christ alone
The King of kings, the Lord of lords
All heaven sings, to Christ alone

To build this church without walls
Let Your glory be shown
Bring salvation to the lost

"I Will Never Be The Same"
Geoff Bullock God Is In The House/ Hillsongs

I will never be the same again
I can never return
I’ve closed the door
I will walk the path
I’ll run the race
And I will never be the same again
Fall like fire, soak like rain
Flow like mighty waters
Again and again
Sweep away the darkness
Burn away the chaff
And let the flame burn
To glorify Your name
There are higher heights
There are deeper seas
Whatever You need to do
Lord, do in me
The glory of God fills my life
And I will never be the same again


"Amazing Grace"
John Newton
-------------
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
Yea when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
Praise God, praise God…
Praise God, praise God…
Praise God, praise God…

Death has lost its victory
And the grave has been denied
Jesus lives forever
He’s alive, He’s alive!

The first and last is He
The curse of sin is broken
And we have perfect liberty
The Lamb of God has risen
He’s alive, He’s alive!
He’s the author and the finisher of our faith
The stone they threw away
Is the Corner stone today
Death has no more vict’ry
And the grave has no more sting
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

The Everlasting Father
He’s the precious Prince of Peace
He’s the Word that lasts forever
He’s alive, He’s alive!

And nothing that you’ve done
Could make Him close the door
Because of His great love
He gave His only Son

How sweet to hold our newborn baby
And feel the pride and joy He gives
But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days
Because He lives
And then one day I’ll cross that river
I’ll fight life’s final war with pain
And then as death gives way to victory

And I’ll know He reigns

"Strong Enough"
Stacy Orrico

As I rest against this cold hard wall,
Will you pass me by?

Only to find the war had just begun
Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out and start again?
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance with me
Please can.. I have one chance to start again
Will my weakness fall and now
Would make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there any way to be made whole again
If I renewed and find forgiveness by the strength I’ve never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God’s plans?
He took my life into His hands
And turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstances,
Is where I’m finally found
That You are strong enough
That You are pure enough
To break  me, pour me out
Pour me out and start again
That You are brave enough
To take care one chance on me,
Oh thank… You are my chance to start again

He is trampling out the vintage where
The grapes of wrath are stored
He has loosed the fateful lightning of
His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on
In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom
That transfigures you and me
As He died to make men holy
Let us live to make men free
His truth is marching on
I can almost hear the trumpet sound
The Lord’s return is near
But there are still so many people lost
Somehow they’ve got to hear
Lord please give me one more hour
One more day, just one more year
With Your truth we’re marching on

"All We Like Sheep"
Don Moen

All we like sheep have gone astray
Each of us turning our own separate way
We have all sinned
And fallen short of Your glory
But Your glory is what we desire to see
And in Your presence is where we long to be
O Lord, show us Your mercy and grace
Take us to Your holy place
Forgive our sin and heal our land
We long to live in Your presence once again
Taking our sickness, taking our pain
Jesus the sacrifice Lamb has been slain
He was despised, rejected by men
He took our sin
Draw us nearer to You Father
Through Jesus Your Son
Let us worship before You
Cleansed by Your blood

In the moment of my weakness

This my song through all my days

All of my hope
All of my strength
All my delight is in You Lord
Forever more

On Mary's lap is sleeping

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant King to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light a star so sweetly gleaming

The King of kings, lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials, born to be our Friend

"O Holy Night"
J.S. Dwight & A.C. Adam

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the souls felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on Your knees
O hear the angels voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night
O night divine
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light a star so sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient Land
The King of kings, lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials, born to be our Friend


"Angels we have heard on high"

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o’er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Why your joyous songs prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King

"For The Cross"
Jenn Johnson, Ian McIntosh & Gabriel Wilson

The life You gave
Your body was broken
Your love poured out
You bled and You died for me
There on the cross
You breathed Your last as You were crucified
You gave it all for me
Hallelujah, what a Saviour
Hallelujah, what a friend
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross
There in the ground
Sealed in the darkness
Lifeless laid
The frame of the Father’s son
In agony
He watched His only Son be sacrificed
He gave it all for me
But on that day
What seemed as the darkest hour
A violent hope
Broke through and shook the ground
And as You rose
The Light of all the world was magnified
And You rose in victory
Hallelujah, it is finished
Hallelujah, it is done
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross
Though our sins are scarlet
You have made us white as snow

"Grace Will Bring You Home"
Faith Ding
-------------
There was a time ago
A King came to this world
God became a Man
For love He bore their sins
He came to heal the hurt
From all its broken pain
By hanging on the Cross
He died and rose again
See, those loving nail-pierced hands
Reaching out to you, giving hope again
His mercy, never ending
His promise, ever true
Such tender loving-kindness
Yearns to be close to you
One moment in His presence
Is better than anywhere
So when you’re lost and feeling all alone
His love will bring you through
And Grace will bring you Home
My friend, He’s seen your pain
Those crying doubts and fears
That none an ear can hear
Doesn’t matter who you are
Whether you are near or far
He wants to make you whole
And beautify your scars
Oh, hear that still small voice within
He’s knocking at your door,
would you let Him in?
He wants to take your shame
Don’t be afraid to call upon His name
His mercy is ever new each day
Don’t walk away, have a lil’ faith
He’ll come right near,
and hold you once again
So when you’re lost and feeling all alone
It’s never too late to come back Home
His love will bring you through
And Grace will bring you Home

Will You meet me here again

The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Saviour of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him
One final breath He gave
As heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love would not be overcome
Now death where is your sting?
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated
(Now) Forever He is glorified
Forever He is lifted high
(And) Forever He is risen
He is alive, He is alive

We sing Hallelujah
The Lamb has overcome

Bright and morning star

"Before the Throne of God Above"
Charitie L. Bancroft & William B. Bradbury

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great high Priest whose Name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in Heaven He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart
When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin
Because of the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me
Behold Him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless righteousness
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace
One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Saviour and my God!
With Christ my Saviour and my God!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the One
Risen Son of God!

Speak to the mountains that
They will humble themselves
Nothing is impossible
Stand on the promises He made,
With a heart full of faith

Nothing is impossible
Now is the hour to rise, with His power at hand
Nothing is impossible
We’re living in revival

Please burn away the darkness, cause love is like a furnace, ignite my soul
Burn, oh my soul, set me on fire
Burn, oh my soul, light up the fire
Burn, oh my soul
Your fire never sleeps, Your fire never sleeps
Stop, I never want to miss You
Something new is being born and we were born for this

You bring a freedom to all that’s within
In the safety of this place I’m longing to…

This is my prayer in the desert
When all that’s within me feels dry

In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flame
And I will bring praise, I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain
I will rejoice, I will declare
God is my victory and He is here
This is my prayer in the battle
When triumph is still on its way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise I’ll stand
All of my life, in every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship
This is my prayer in the harvest
When favor and providence flow
I know I’m filled to be emptied again
The seed I’ve received I will sow

When the music fades, all is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself

You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You
All about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord for the things I've made it
When it's all about You
All about You, Jesus

How much You deserve
Though I'm weak and poor all I have is Yours
Every single breath
It's all about You
All about You, Jesus

"Your Love Never Fails"

Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away
Your love never fails
-
I know I still make mistakes
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Your love never fails
-
You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning
And when the oceans rage
I don’t have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails
-
The wind is strong and the water’s deep
But I’m not alone in these open seas
Cause Your love never fails

Work together for my good

"Voice of Truth"
Casting Crowns
-------------
Oh what I would do to have the kind of faith
It takes to climb out of this boat I’m in
Onto the crashing waves
To step out of my comfort zone
To the realm of the unknown where Jesus is
And He’s holding out his hand
But the waves are calling out my name
And they laugh at me
Reminding me of all the times
I’ve tried and failed
The waves they keep on telling me
Time and time again “Boy, you’ll never win”
“You’ll never win”
The voice of truth tells me a different story
And the voice of truth says “Do not be afraid”
And the voice of truth says
“This is for my glory”
Out of all the voices calling out to me
I will choose to listen and believe
The voice of truth
Oh what I would do to have
The kind of strength it takes
To stand before a giant
With just a sling and a stone
Surround by the sound of a thousand warrior
Things in the past, things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
All of my hopes, all of my plans
My heart and my hands are lifted to You 
What can we give that You have not given
And what do we have  that is not already Yours
All we posses, are these lives we’re living
And that’s what we give to You Lord

Cannot overflow me
Where my feet are on a Rock
I want to hide where the blazing fire
Cannot burn me
In Your presence O God
I want to hide where the flood of evil
Cannot reach me
Where I’m covered by Your blood
I want to be where the schemes of darkness
Cannot touch me
In Your presence O God
You are my firm foundation
I trust in You all day long
I am Your child and Your servant
And You are the strength and my song
You’re my song

Just waiting to be discovered

The humble and the meek
Only the hungry dine
Only the thirsty drink deep
You saved Yourself for the needy
You saved Yourself for me
I want to waste my life
To search You out

And stand in reverent awe
Show Your majesty and glory
Let Your anointing fall
As we declare Your name Lord Jesus
As the only name who saves
May the power of Your salvation
Fill each heart we pray
As we worship You

The song of Jesus and His blood
That proved His love for all

May all the lost and broken come
May they hear Your still small voice
Call out their names each one
As we worship You

As we cry out for the nations
Pour out revival in the land

Joel Houston

A thousand times I’ve failed
Still Your mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I’m caught in Your grace
Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame
In my heart, in my soul
I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out
Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out

Gonna run into Your arms

Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true

In mercy gathered, mended and whole
Empty handed, but not forsaken

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I am found
Was blind but now I see
Oh I can see it now
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life
You take our failure, You take our weakness
You set Your treasure, in jars of clay
So take this heart, Lord, I’ll be Your vessel
The world to see, Your love in me


"Letting Go"
Steffany Gretzinger
-------------
You've brought me to the end of myself
This has been the longest road
Just when my hallelujah was tired
You gave me a new song
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
Falling into You
I confess I still get scared sometimes
But perfect love comes rushing in
And all the lies screamed inside go silent
The moment You begin
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
Falling into You
You remind me of things forgotten
You unwind me until I'm totally undone
And with Your arms around me
Fear was no match for Your love
Now You've won me
And if I lived a thousand lifetimes
And wrote a song for every day
Still there would be no way to say
How You have loved me
Oh, how You love me
And that's how You've won me

"Worlds Apart"
Dan Haseltine, Jars of Clay
-------------
I am the only one to blame for this
Somehow it all adds up the same
Soaring on the wings of selfish pride
I flew too high and like Icarus I collide
With a world I try so hard to leave behind
To rid myself of all but love to give and die
To turn away and not become
Another nail to pierce the skin of One who loves
More deeply than the oceans
More abundant than the tears
Of a world embracing ev’ry heartache
Can I be the one to sacrifice or grip the spear
And watch the blood and water flow?
To love You – take my world apart
To need You – I am on my knee
To love You – take my world apart
To need You – broken on my knees
All said and done I stand alone
Amongst remains of a life I should not own
It takes all I am to believe
In the mercy that covers me
Did You really have to die for me?
All I am for all You are ‘cause what I need
And what I believe are worlds apart
I look beyond the empty cross
Forgetting what my life has cost
Wipe away the crimson stains
And dull the nails that still remain
More and more I need You now
I owe You more each passing hour
The battle between grace and pride
I gave up not so long ago
So, steal my heart and take the pain
Wash the feet, cleanse my pride
Take the selfish, take the weak
And all the things I cannot hide
Take the beauty, take my tears
Sin-soaked heart, and make it Yours
Take my world apart
Take it now, take it now
And serve the ones that I despise
Speak the words I can’t deny
Watch the world I used to know
Fall to dust and thrown away
I look beyond the empty cross
Forgetting what my life has cost
So, wipe away the crimson stains
And dull the nails that still remain
So, steal my heart and take the pain
Take the selfish, take the weak
And all the things I cannot hide
Take the beauty, take my tears
Take my world apart
Take my world apart
And I pray, and I pray, and I pray
Take my world apart


"He is Faithful"

He is Jesus, all my hope is in Him
He is freedom, He is healing right now
He is hope and joy, love and peace and life
I have seen a light like the break of dawn
Giving blind men sight and letting the lame men walk

We are a generation filled with the power of Christ
He has paid the highest price
He has proven His great love for us
We will praise Him with our lives
And proclaim our love for Him

Without You there to see me through
Imagine me without You

Because of You, it’s all brand new
My life is now worthwhile
I can’t imagine me without You

And I realize just how beautiful You are
And how great Your affections are for me
And oh, how He loves us so
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves us so
Yeah, He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves
And we are His portion and He is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes

And my heart turns violently
Inside of my chest
I don’t have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way

You breathed Your last as You were crucified
You gave it all for me
Hallelujah, what a Saviour
Hallelujah, what a friend
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross
There in the ground
Sealed in the darkness
Lifeless laid
The frame of the Father’s son
In agony
He watched His only Son be sacrificed
He gave it all for me
But on that day
What seemed as the darkest hour
A violent hope
Broke through and shook the ground
And as You rose
The Light of all the world was magnified
And You rose in victory
Hallelujah, it is finished
Hallelujah, it is done
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross
Though our sins are scarlet
You have made us white as snow
